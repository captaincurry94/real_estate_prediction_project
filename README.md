This project deals with predicting house prices in King County, Washington. 

After the data is being cleaned and explored in the first part of the script, multiple attempts for linear regression models are being tested, to predict house prices. Therein, the single best predicting feature as well as the best feature combination with maximum 4 features is being discovered.

To improve model performance, a feature on average price per squarefoot was calculated for each zipcode. It is debateable, if the model gets too much information about the dependent variable already. An issue that can be further discussed and collaborated on
